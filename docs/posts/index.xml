      <description>In the theme that I use on this site Poison, the syntax highlighting for codeblocks was not working by default.
Hugo gives us the ability to override theme files by the static/ folder in our site&amp;rsquo;s root directory (where config.toml lives).
More specifically, in the case of Poison, the file in question was under:
1 themes/poison/static/css/syntax.css Generate the desired syntax highlighting stylesheet To override it we need to generate a syntax.</description>

      <description>With guides it is easy, but it took me a while to google out the answer, so I shall leave the steps to take generating a HUGO website and posting it onto github for future reference.
You will need git and hugo installed for this.
This guide expects you to be familiar with the command line and Github, as well as having read the quick-start guide on HUGO.
Step 0. - (LINUX) Make sure you have github ssh key setup Step 0.</description>

      <description>This is a blog post for the archival of my YUMS project.
We had a good run, a month of development that taught me much. But in the end. It all ends the same. Just another bowl of &amp;ldquo;modular&amp;rdquo; sphagetti.
What was the plan? A simple, barebones implementation that is extendable and scalable. It also should use as few dependancies as possible.
There was already an immensely more mature and batteries included framework called Evennia.</description>
