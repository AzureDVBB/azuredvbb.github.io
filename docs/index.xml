      <description>This is a blog post for the archival of my YUMS project.
We had a good run, a month of development that taught me much. But in the end. It all ends the same. Just another bowl of &amp;ldquo;modular&amp;rdquo; sphagetti.
What was the plan? A simple, barebones implementation that is extendable and scalable. It also should use as few dependancies as possible.
There was already an immensely more mature and batteries included framework called Evennia.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my corner of the internet! This is primarily the place where I keep my notes on the open source projects and repositories I make, or summary posts of things I have learned.
Hopefully watching the barren landscape here will keep me motivated on doing more stuff!
Take a beverage of your choice and have a pleasant read! (note: may contain ramblings)
Who am I? Just a hobby programmer/gamer sharing my knowledge across the internet.</description>
