### _Welcome to my corner of the internet!_

This is primarily the place where I keep my notes on the open source projects and repositories I make, or summary posts of things I have learned.

Hopefully watching the barren landscape here will keep me motivated on doing more stuff!

Take a beverage of your choice and have a pleasant read!
