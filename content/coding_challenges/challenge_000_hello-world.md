## Introduction

Hello there!
Welcome to my own list of coding challenges born from frustrations with the google results to 'coding challenge' being either not related or subscription services.

Already planning on learning a few new languages, I figured the best way to do so is set a nice gauntlet of challenges to myself.
Doing the research of each subject, setting goals and writing an article about it to brush up many new skills.

And what better then to share it with others!
Hopefully this series will be useful to someone else as well.

## Challenge Details

Being essentially a 'Hello World!' there isn't much in terms of details that is necessary.
